Have a question that you can't find answer to in the [Rhino documentation](./_docs/documentation.md)? Here are some additional resources for help:

#### Mailing List

Rhino discussions happen on the [mozilla-rhino](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-rhino) group on Google Groups.

There is a much older group, [mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine.rhino](news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine.rhino), that is no longer actively used. Please use the new group instead, but the old one may be of historical interest.

The [mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine](news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine) newsgroup answers questions about the C implementation of JavaScript, and was also used for answering questions about Rhino until September 27, 2007. To view archived messages _earlier than_ September 27, 2007, try [Google group for the earlier newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine/topics).

#### Bug System

The best way to enter Rhino bugs to enter an [issue in GitHub.](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues)

If you have the inclination to fix it, you are also encouraged to fix it and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pulls).

Many older Rhino issues were logged in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Rhino). There may be some bugs there of historical interest. Note that Rhino has its own product category.
