### ECMAScript 5 support

ECMAScript 5 support was added to Rhino by Raphael Speyer during a Google Summer of Code project mentored by Norris Boyd. Rhino 1.7R3 supports most of ES5 except for Strict Mode.

### JavaScript 1.8 support

Rhino 1.7R3 has partial support for [JavaScript 1.8](https://web.archive.org/web/20210502042346mp_/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/1.8) contributed by Hannes Walln√∂fer and Andreas Bolka. This includes expression closures and destructuring assignment shorthand but not generator expressions.

Note that JavaScript 1.8 features have to be enabled explicitly by selecting language version `180` in the shell, or `Context.VERSION_1_8` in embedded mode.

### New AST API

Steve Yegge has contributed a new AST API to Rhino which should be useful for people building JavaScript specific tools. The AST classes are in the `org.mozilla.javascript.ast` package.

### CommonJS module support

A fully compliant [CommonJS module implementation](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1) was contributed by Attila Szegedi. CommonJS modules are also available in the Rhino shell using the `-modules`, `-main`, and `-sandbox` command line options.

### JS Objects implement Java collections

JavaScript Objects now implement the `java.util.Map` interface while Arrays implement `java.util.List`. This means that JavaScript objects can be passed seamlessly to Java methods expecting a Map while arrays can be passed to methods expecting a List or java.util.Collection.

### JSDoc comment parsing

The Rhino parser is now capable of recognizing JSDoc-like comments (starting with `/**`). This feature is disabled by default and has to be enabled by setting the corresponding flag in the `CompilerEnviron` object.

### Performance improvements

Rhino has seen some performance improvements since the last release which are most notable when running benchmarks or the test suite.
