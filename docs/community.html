<p>Have a question that you can't find answer to in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino/Documentation" title="en/Rhino_documentation">Rhino documentation</a>? Here are some additional resources for help:</p>

<h4 id="Newsgroup_and_Mail_Gateway" name="Newsgroup_and_Mail_Gateway">Mailing List</h4>

<p>Rhino discussions happen on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-rhino">mozilla-rhino</a> group on Google Groups.</p>

<p>There is a much older group, <a class="link-news" href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine.rhino" style="line-height: 23.3333339691162px;">mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine.rhino</a>, that is no longer actively used. Please use the new group instead, but the old one may be of historical interest.</p>

<p>The <a class="link-news" href="news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine">mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine</a> newsgroup answers questions about the C implementation of JavaScript, and was also used for answering questions about Rhino until September 27, 2007. To view archived messages <em>earlier than</em> September 27, 2007, try <a class="external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.js-engine/topics">Google group for the earlier newsgroup</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Bug_System" name="Bug_System">Bug System</h4>

<p>The best way to enter Rhino bugs to enter an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues">issue in GitHub.</a> </p>

<p>If you have the inclination to fix it, you are also encouraged to fix it and submit a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>

<p>Many older Rhino issues were logged in <a class="link-https" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Rhino">Bugzilla</a>. There may be some bugs there of historical interest. Note that Rhino has its own product category.</p>
