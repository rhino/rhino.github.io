How are people using Rhino?</h1></center>
Here's a partial list of the ways people are using Rhino in their projects.
The initial list was collected by Netscape marketing, so Rhino is referred
to as Netscape Java-based JavaScript. We'd love to hear how you're using
Rhino--just mail&nbsp;<script>document.write(owner());</script>

<br>"Netscape JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation was a perfect solution
for developing our MacroRecorder because it made our development process
faster and better, and our customers get a more efficient, reliable, and
standards based product as a result," said Rob Clark, Director of Product
Development at Attachmate. Attachmate integrates Netscape's Java-based
JavaScript 1.5 Interpreter into its 100% Pure Java certified web-to-host
thin clients, called e-Vantage Viewers. The Netscape Java-based JavaScript
interpreter is used in a MacroRecorder feature that allows browser-based
users to efficiently navigate host applications on mainframe and midrange
systems.
<p><a href="http://www.bristowhill.com/">Bristow Hill Software</a>
<br>"We thought it would require lots of work to add scripting capability
to Bristow Hill Server Pages, but we were delighted to find that Netscape
JavaScript 1.5 with Java implementation fit right in with only a couple
of lines of initialization code and one line of code to export our standard
objects by name. Also, we were pleased to find we could take embedded scripting
and compile it down to Java classes which could be used directly for greater
speed in production. Netscape's JavaScript engine is rock solid and standards
compliant, and my only regret is that we didn't start using it sooner,"
said Don Anderson, President of Bristow Hill Software.
<p><a href="http://www.icesoft.no/">ICEsoft</a>
<br>ICEsoft adds JavaScript support to their <a href="http://www.icesoft.no/ICEBrowser/">ICE
Browser</a> using Rhino.
<p><a href="http://www.vmeng.com/beard/JShell/Release_Notes.html">JShell</a>
<br>Rhino is used as the scripting language for the open source command
shell JShell written by Patrick Beard.
<p><a href="http://www.softcom.com">Softcom</a>
<br>The tight integration of Netscape's Java-based JavaScript 1.5 with
Softcom's Java-based RealPlayer plugin, RJ, enables Softcom to quickly
produce dynamic interactive video applications for our media/entertainment,
retail and professional education clients, helping us to synchronize the
full interactivity of the Web and e-commerce with streaming video, said
Chris O'Brien, president and COO of Softcom. For the enhanced Oscarcast
recently produced for E! Online during the Academy Awards, Softcom used
RJ to embed Netscape's JavaScript 1.5 in the RealPlayer, successfully integrating
interactive chat and Java games, along with streaming video, within the
RealPlayer.
<p><a href="http://www.tdiinc.com/">Technology Deployment International</a>
<br>"Technology Deployment International selected the Java-based Netscape
JavaScript engine to incorporate into the workflow module of our eBusiness
Management System (eBMS) allowing our customers to integrate business logic
into any workstep of their application," said Dr. Kelvin Liu, VP eBMS Development,
Technology Deployment International. "It has been easy to embed, the support
we received from the engineering team has been outstanding, and the performance
of the JavaScript code is almost identical to the equivalent Java."
<p><a href="http://www.xypoint.com/">XYPOINT</a>
<br>XYPOINT uses Rhino for automating test cases of their Java classes
used in their service <a href="http://www.webwirelessnow.com/">WebWirelessNow</a>.
Abraham Backus says that he's happy with Rhino because "I've always wanted
this kind of JavaScript support."
