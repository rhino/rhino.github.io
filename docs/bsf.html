<h2 id="What_is_BSF">What is BSF?</h2>

<p>The <a class="ex-ref" href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/"><dfn>Bean Scripting Framework (or BSF)</dfn></a> was originally developed by IBM and now published as open source as a project at the Apache Software Foundation. It provides a framework for using a number of scripting languages with Java. Rhino is one of the supported languages.</p>

<p>This framework has been embedded in a number of open source projects, including the XSL processor <a class="ex-ref" href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/">Xalan</a> and the XML/Java build tool <a class="ex-ref" href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>. See <a class="ex-ref" href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html">Xalan-Java Extensions</a> for more information on adding JavaScript to XSL and the description of the optional Script task in the <a class="ex-ref" href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/">Apache Ant Manual</a> for using scripting in Ant build files.</p>
