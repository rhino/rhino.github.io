<p>
<font color="red"><center>This release of the Debugger API should be considered to be of Beta quality.</center></font>
<p>
The Debugger API for Rhino consists of a set of Java interfaces 
which describes a high level debugger API and a default implementation of that
API.
<p>
Most of the API is in the <code>com.netscape.javascript.debug</code> package. It is built 
upon low-level support built into the core engine in <code>com.netscape.javascript</code>. 
<p>
The <code>com.netscape.javascript.debug</code> package includes an implementation of the Debugger API 
interfaces outlined below. The class <code>com.netscape.javascript.debug.DebugManager.java</code> 
implements the <a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IDebugManager.html">IDebugManager</a> 
interface and <code>com.netscape.javascript.debug.SourceTextManagerImpl.java</code> implements 
the <a href="com/netscape/javascript/SourceTextManager.html">SourceTextManager</a> interface. 
<p>
The class <code>com.netscape.javascript.tools.shell.Main.java</code> provides an 
example which invokes the Debugger API.

<p>
The core interface of the API is <a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IDebugManager.html">IDebugManager</a>.
This interface provide the central point for interacting with the debug system. 
It supports the setting of the following hooks:
<ul>
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IInterruptHook.html">IInterruptHook</a> for immediate interrupt.                     
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IInstructionHook.html">IInstructionHook</a> for breakpoints.                             
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IDebugBreakHook.html">IDebugBreakHook</a> for breaking on errors.                      
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IErrorReporter.html">IErrorReporter</a> for hooking into the error reporter system.  
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IScriptHook.html">IScriptHook</a> for notification of script and function load and unload.  
</ul>
Customers of the Debugger API can provide implementations of these hook 
interfaces which can be passed to the <i>IDebugManager</i> in order receive 
notification of the various events within the core JavaScript engine.
<p>
When hooks are called they are passed appropriate objects which are implemented 
by the Debugger API to describe such things as <i>stack frames</i>, 
<i> program counter locations</i>, etc. The interfaces for these objects are:
<ul>
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IThreadState.html">IThreadState</a> representing the state of the stopped thread.
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IStackFrame.html">IStackFrame</a> representing a stack frame.
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IPC.html">IPC</a> representing a program counter location.
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/IScript.html">IScript</a> representing a compiled JavaScript script or function.
<li><a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/ISourceLocation.html">ISourceLocation</a> representing a location in the souce code.
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<a href="com/netscape/javascript/SourceTextManager.html">SourceTextManager</a> 
is an interface used to supply a centralized location from which a debugger 
client can access JavaScript source. It supports capturing source  as it is 
parsed by <i>Rhino</i>. Alternately, source can be fed to it by the 
embedding; e.g. in a browser embedding where the JavaScript code is just a 
part of the html source the browser can feed the entire source to the 
<i>SourceTextManager</i> so that a debugger can 'see' the whole source and 
not just the part that is fed to the JavaScript compiler.
<p>
<a href="com/netscape/javascript/SourceTextItem.html">SourceTextItem</a> is an 
interface representing a single 'block' of source code text (typically this 
is an entire source file). This may be pure JavaScript source, or may include 
JavaScript source embedded in html or whatever. The point is that this is the 
text that a debugger should show to a user while debugging the JavaScript code. 
This interface supports incrementally updated content. This is specifically 
useful in browser embeddings where text is received in blocks. In fact, in a 
browser it is possible that some of the source on a page may be compiled 
and run even before the entire content of the page has been received from a 
server.

<p>
<a href="com/netscape/javascript/debug/ILaunchableDebugger.html">ILaunchableDebugger</a> 
is an interface that abstractly represents a debugger user interface. It is 
defined to allow an embedding to request that a debugger be launched without 
requiring that the embedding be coupled at compile time to a particular debugger 
implementation.

<h3>Limitations and unimplemented features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data Watchpoints are not implemented.
<li>Catching exceptions thrown in JavaScript code is not implemented.
<li>Per context hooking is not implemented.
<li>Setting the debug level to any non-zero value forces the optimization level to zero.
<li>Tracking of calls to plain Java methods from JavaScript is not implemented.
<li>Running at debug level >= 6 causes JIT errors with the Symantec JVM (but no other JVMs)
<li>The Debug API has not been rigorously tested. 
</ul>
